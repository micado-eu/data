This is the repository that hosts the data collection for the MICADO project.

The need of the project is to collect data of different typologies:
* dashboarding data
* process data

## Dashboarding data
This data represents aphanumeric data that can either be plotted on a graph, a timeline or a map; some examples can be: 
* open data from UN sources on people migration statistic from source country to destination country divided by year
* information on physicians with consulting hours, map location and language spoken

In the corresponding folder we'll collect either the open data that the project has found and decided to use, or the schema of the data that we plan to use in case that the data can be made available to the project, but is not open to public use.

## Process data
Information on how a specific process with the public administration needs to be executed in terms of steps, documents needed in each step, generated in each step, money to be payed for each document or step, location where the step has to be done etc.

Examples can be:
* how to renew a residence permit
* how to enlist a child in school

In the corresponding folder we'll create a single folder for each process with all the available information: process description, steps, document samples/templates.

## MICADO DB
This folder host the schema for Micado DB.

All changes and comments on the DB will be managed in this repositories with issues and Push Requests.
